            What sets VCG apart is not only the unique club culture and dynamic of our members, 
            but our professional development program and new member training. We believe that learning 
            is the most valuable opportunity that this club has to offer, so we make a strong point to ensure 
            our members have solid foundational skills to prepare them for their projects and beyond. 
            Every member's experience in Valley is different, so we encourage applicants to reach out 
            for coffee chats to gain deeper insights into what it means to be a VCG consultant.

            Valley is a highly professional organization that regularly deals with tech giants and esteemed clients. 
            Given our proven track record of success, we strive to uphold our position as a top consulting club at Berkeley, 
            as individual members and as an organization.
            Our members also share a very tight-knit community. Through shared experiences and interests, our members 
            have built lasting friendships during their undergraduate years. We regularly plan social events within Valley, 
            as well as with the broader consulting community at Berkeley, to deepen our connections with each other and those around us.

            Consultants can expect to work in small teams of 7-9 members. Project Leads will give weekly tasks to their teams of Consultants, 
            with additional support from our Senior Advisors. Projects may vary depending on client requests, meaning there can be many 
            differences between the needs of one project versus another.

            Based on the McKinsey Professional Development program, Valley's "Dev" program provides new members with essential consulting 
            skills and personalized career growth opportunities. New members will enhance their public speaking abilities, master the art of 
            crafting impactful presentation decks, and delve into practical topics like personal finance. Upon joining, you will also benefit 
            from resume reviews, receive tailored one-on-one mentorship for career development, and so much more!
            Each new member also ideates, roadmaps, executes, and presents a Capstone project at the end of the semester, which can range 
            from developing a new app to launching a startup or consulting for a local business. Capstone projects are entirely open-ended 
            and are an opportunity for consultants to further their personal and professional interests under the guidance of experienced members.

            We're looking for passionate individuals who are invested in their professional and personal growth! 
            We want new members who genuinely love VCG and the people just as much as we do and who can't wait
            to dive into the project work and their professional development.

            We highly recommend coming out to our Case Workshop on September 5th from 8PM-10PM in VLSB 2050 to prepare for our first round group interview!
            There, we'll cover everything you need to know to do your best — no prior experience necessary! After group interviews, we will be sending invitations to
            the individual interview round, which will have a behavioral as well as a technical portion. We do recommend looking into the STAR method for behavioral 
            interviews and coming to Case Workshop for more tips on the technical portion, but we just want to get to know you more as a person, so just be yourself!

          What does the first semester as a new member look like?

            Weekly 2-hr professional development sessions, weekly class socials, client project meetings, club-wide and cross-club socials, and so much more! 
            Your first semester at VCG is truly a vibrant experience where you'll be fully integrated into the club, socially and professionally. 
            New members typically spend anywhere from 10 to 20 hours a week on VCG, but that includes socials and internal coffee chats on top of the professional work!

            We highly recommend coming to just one of our Info Sessions (the same information will be covered at both) and coming to the Case Workshop 
            to prepare for the interview process, but you can always come meet us at tabling on Sproul/the Glade and sign up for coffee chats!

            Not at all! In fact, many of our members had no relevant experience before joining VCG. Rest assured we will prepare you with all the 
            skills you'll need to succeed professionally, so we definitely encourage everyone regardless of your background to come out and apply!
